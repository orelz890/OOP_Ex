# OOP_Ex

This project is an assignment in the object-oriented course at Ariel University(second year).
The problem in general:
We face with the offline algorithem problem. meaning the algorithem input is a json file named "Bilding.json" and a csv file named "Calls_*.csv"
The first contains all the relevent data about a specific building -  min/max floor and a list of elevators(with the relevent data about them)
The second stores the future calls in a specified time

Our mission: assigning the most afficient elevator to all the imput calls.
